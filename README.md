## Overview

FashionFlow Intelligence is an end-to-end AI solution for fashion retailers that:
1. Predicts future demand using machine learning
2. Optimizes inventory levels
3. Prevents stockouts and overstock situations
4. Provides actionable inventory recommendations

The system analyzes historical sales data to forecast demand and calculate optimal stock levels, helping retailers maximize sales while minimizing inventory costs.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Demand Forecasting**:
  - Ensemble modeling with XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression
  - Advanced feature engineering with lag/rolling features
  - Temporal pattern recognition (seasonality, trends)
  
- **Smart Inventory Optimization**:
  - Safety stock calculation
  - Reorder point recommendations
  - Stock status classification (Critical/Low/Medium/High)
  
- **Visual Analytics Dashboard**:
  - Interactive forecast vs actual visualization
  - Model performance metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²)
  - Residual analysis
  
- **Enterprise-Ready Architecture**:
  - Production-grade error handling
  - Comprehensive data validation
  - Time-series aware cross-validation
  - Holiday calendar integration

## Dataset Used

This project uses the [M5 forcasting Retail Dataset]([https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/m5-forecasting-accuracy/data)) containing:

-
- Time period: 12/2010 - 12/2011
- Key attributes:
  - StockCode (Product ID)
  - Description
  - Quantity
  - InvoiceDate
  - UnitPrice
  - CustomerID
  - Country

## Installation

1. Clone repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fashionflow-intelligence.git
cd fashionflow-intelligence
```

2. Create virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Place your retail data in the project directory as `Online Retail.xlsx`
2. Run the main script:
```bash
python fashionflow.py
```

3. View results:
- Forecast visualizations will display automatically
- Inventory recommendations printed in console
- Top product analysis summary report

## Configuration

Modify `FashionFlowConfig` in the code for:
```python
class FashionFlowConfig:
    # Model Parameters
    XGBOOST_PARAMS = { ... }  # XGBoost hyperparameters
    
    # Feature Engineering
    LAG_FEATURES = [1, 2, 3, 7, 14]  # Lag periods
    ROLLING_WINDOWS = [7, 14, 30]    # Rolling windows
    
    # Business Rules
    SAFETY_STOCK_MULTIPLIER = 1.5    # Safety stock factor
    REORDER_POINT_DAYS = 7            # Lead time in days
```
